# HOW TO USE

 - Download Corrector.py and start.bat

 - You will need [Python](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.13.0/python-3.13.0-amd64.exe)

 - Add all the meme folders you downloaded before into the same folder that the Corrector file and the Start file are in (AND ONLY THOSE, THE SCRIPT WILL LOOK THROUGH ANY FOLDER THAT IS IN THE SAME FOLDER AS IT)

 - Once you have all the folders there, you can run the Start file, and it will change the names of all of the files so that nothing will end up trying to replace another meme when you go to move them all to one folder!
